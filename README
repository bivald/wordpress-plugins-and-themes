By: Niklas Bivald <niklas@bivald.com>

INTRODUCTION
Latest Github Commits is a simple and to-the-point Wordpress widget that 
fetches the latest Github Commits from a user and project. It caches
the data locally using Wordpress built-in Transients storage.

It fetches the data using Githubs API

You need to configure:
 - Github owner of the project (i.e bivald)
 - Project URL (i.e wordpress-latest-github-commits)

And can also set:
 - Widget title
 - Max commits to list
 - How long to cache

INSTALL
Place the PHP file in your plugin folder, enable and add the widget. 

NOTES
It's an early version - use with care.
